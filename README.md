## Installation

To install after cloning the repo, just run `npm i` to import dependencies.

## Usage

After specifying a server in your .env file (or installing a local copy of MongoDB for local testing), you can boot up the Express server by running `npm start`.

## Testing

If test data is required, you can use `npm run seed` to seed the database with a handful of users along with random thoughts and reactions.
